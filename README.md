## Hi there 👋 I'm Xixiao (Cecilia) Pan



🎓 **M.S. in Computer Science @ University of Southern California (USC)**  
📍 Previously: **B.S.E. in Data Science Engineering @ University of Michigan**  
💡 Passionate about **AI systems, distributed computing, and generative models**.

I am actively looking for internship opportunities in SDE/MLE in 2026 Summer.

I’ve built large-scale intelligent systems integrating ML models with distributed architectures.  
At **AMD**, I developed the *Wingman AI Debug Agent* and optimized LLM & diffusion model inference on AMD GPUs (3× faster).  
At **Artisk.ai**, I engineered containerized Flask microservices on GCP handling 10K+ daily requests with Redis-based async pipelines.  
My other projects include a Paxos-based distributed key-value store, a full-stack AI logo generator, and a NeRF implementation in PyTorch.

🧩 **Interests:** AI agents · Distributed systems · Computer graphics · LLM infrastructure
